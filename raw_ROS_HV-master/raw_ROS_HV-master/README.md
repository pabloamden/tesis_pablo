Transcription and annotation of the HV sample in ROS

1) All the sample is initially annotated by one permanent RA, a fluent user of CHAT (she has been transcribing multi-participant situations according to this format for 8 years). She is also well trained in ELAN annotation and has approved both the Spanish and English Gold Standard for the ACLEW DAS.
2) Given that audios in ROS frequently have many speakers and electronic media as background, a second pass is needed. Another coder (a graduate student, also very well trained in CHAT and ELAN and that has approved the Spanish and English Gold Standard for the ACLEW DAS) hears the audio again and checks consistency across speakers, and, in general, annotations. Disagreements are resolved in a third pass by the PI or one of the 3 co-PIs.
3) Consistency across speakers is a difficult issue in this corpora due to the amount of participants in the situations recorded (eg. it is very difficult to distinguish the voices of 3 or 4 different FA members of the same family). When transcription is done in rounds it is difficult (or almost imposible) to maintain consistency across rounds regarding the identification of speakers. That is why in ROS all the clips that correspond to a child are transcribed and annotated sequentially.
4) The fact that all the files are revised by a second annotator and that eventual discrepancies are resolved in a third pass by a senior researcher guarantee the correction of eventual errors resulting from drifts in the work done by the first annotator.
